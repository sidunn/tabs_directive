#tabs_directive 

This is my version of the code in a Thinkster.io tutorial that focuses on how to use element directives in AngularJS.

According to the tutorial: "A directive is a way of defining HTML elements that use JavaScript to create custom behaviours. There are two main types of directives: elements and attributes (also referred to as decorators). Elements contain their own custom templates and are used as actual HTML elements. Attributes are used as attributes on existing HTML elements to add new behaviours such as onclick functionality."

To run this code, copy the files into a directory and bring up a local server with browser-sync. For example: browser-sync start --server --port 3001 --files="./*"
